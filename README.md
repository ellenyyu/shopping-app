When to Use Pip or Conda?
So, when should you use pip or conda? Here are some guidelines:

Use pip if you are working with pure Python projects and need access to the vast array of libraries available on PyPI.
Use conda if you are working with projects that use multiple languages, need different versions of Python, or require complex binary dependencies.
In many cases, you can use both tools in the same project. For example, you can use conda to manage environments and install binary packages, and pip to install Python libraries that are not available through conda.


1. pip install -r requirements.txt
conda 
conda install pip 
pip install beautifulsoup4, google-auth, google-api-python-client, 
#python-dotenv
